## My Projects
### SocketGame - https://github.com/xlukacs/SocketGame
This is a game I am working on, which envolves sockets for realtime game servers and graphics based on OpenGL and ThreeJs.

### An example webshop - https://github.com/xlukacs/WebshopPublic
The projects goal was to get a better understanding of the newest security features in PHP. The webshop is based on Blade templates and connects to a PostgreSQL database, which is managed through migrations.
